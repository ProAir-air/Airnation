If you want to allow dynamic ngrok subdomains (useful because ngrok URLs change every time unless you use a custom subdomain), use a wildcard:


ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '.ngrok-free.app']

STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']  

python manage.py collectstatic


Provide the HTTPS link generated by ngrok (`https://513f-41-86-184-7.ngrok-free.app`) to your friends. They can access your website through this link.

To share your local development server with others using Ngrok, you need to start an Ngrok tunnel and update your Django `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting.











Since you are using a wildcard (`.ngrok-free.app`) in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, you need to ensure that `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` are properly configured.

CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://127.0.0.1",
    "http://localhost",
    "https://*.ngrok-free.app"
]

### **2. `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`**
This setting should also include full URLs (with `http://` or `https://`) of allowed origins for cross-origin requests.


CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://127.0.0.1",
    "http://localhost",
    "https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app"
]
```

However, **CORS does not support wildcards** like `*.ngrok-free.app`. You must explicitly list each allowed subdomain.

If you want to allow all subdomains dynamically, use:

```python
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True  # Not recommended for production
```

or use `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES`:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
    r"^https:\/\/.*\.ngrok-free\.app$"
]
```
