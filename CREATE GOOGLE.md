To get the required `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` for your Google Drive integration, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Create a Google Cloud Project**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click **"Select a project"**, then **"New Project"**.
3. Give your project a name (e.g., `Django Drive Integration`).
4. Click **"Create"** and wait for it to be set up.

---

### **2. Enable Google Drive API**
1. In the **Google Cloud Console**, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
2. Search for **"Google Drive API"** and enable it.
3. Also, enable the **Google Cloud IAM API** (for permissions management).

---

### **3. Create a Service Account**
1. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** â†’ **"Service Account"**.
3. Enter a name (e.g., `drive-service-account`), then click **"Create and Continue"**.
4. Assign a role (e.g., **"Editor"** or **"Owner"** if needed).
5. Click **"Done"**.

---

### **4. Generate and Download JSON Credentials**
1. In the **Service Accounts** list, click on the newly created account.
2. Go to the **Keys** tab, then click **"Add Key"** â†’ **"Create New Key"**.
3. Select **"JSON"** and click **"Create"**.
4. A JSON file (your `service-account-credentials.json`) will be downloaded. Save it securely.

---

### **5. Share the Google Drive Folder with the Service Account**
1. Open [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
2. Create a folder for storing files.
3. Right-click the folder â†’ **"Share"**.
4. Copy the email of your service account from the JSON file (looks like `your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
5. Paste it in the **"Share with people and groups"** box.
6. Set **permissions** to **"Editor"** so it can upload files.

---

### **6. Update Django Settings**
Modify your Django settings:

```python
GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETTINGS = {
    'SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE': 'path/to/service-account-credentials.json',  # Replace with actual path
    'SCOPES': ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file'],
    'API_VERSION': 'v3'
}
```
Make sure the JSON file is in a **secure location** and not publicly accessible.

---

### **7. Install Required Libraries**
```sh
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```
